    "utterance": "oh, i walked by bloomingdale's the other day, and i saw that massage chair we want to get joe mayo as an apartment gift."
  },

  },
  {
    "utterance": "i can't stand joe mayo's parties. you know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'hey, can you do me a favor? can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' uh..."

  },
  {
    "utterance": "why?"
  },

  },
  {
    "utterance": "yeah, so now i can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies."

    "utterance": "wallet."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "what?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "nobody carries wallets anymore. i mean, they went out with powdered wigs. yeah, see here's what you need. just a couple of cards and your bankroll. see, keep the big bills on the outside."

  },
  {
    "utterance": "like what?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "well, i... uh, nothing. no, i'll, um, i'll switch it back."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "no, no, no, no. no, that's all right."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "well, that's good. because, uh, newman and i--"

  },
  {

  },
  {
    "utterance": "i'll have 'em overnight it."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "maybe cheapness is a sense. you know it is better without this big wallet. it's more comfortable."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "it doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. it's wrong."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "why?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "because important things go in a case. you got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "but look at this thing. it's-it's huge. you got more cow here than here."

  {
    "utterance": "the reverse peepholes. silvio said i'm an agitator and i'm out of the building."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "no. no, he can't do that."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "i'm homeless! i'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. i'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket."

    "utterance": "love to."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "utterance": "so, george... did you get the chair?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "no, i don't have it yet."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "so, we're givin' him nothing?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "no, i brought a picture of the chair."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "did you at least get him a card?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "i thought we'd all sign the picture."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "hey, joe mayo."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "oh, fantastic."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "sure thing, joe mayo."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "hi, i'm jerry. how do you like my pants?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "nice."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "(talking to george) it's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) don't tap on the glass."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "(answering the phone while walking away) joe mayo's apartment?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "(standing guard by the stereo as george walks by him) hey! cocktail off the speaker."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "goodbye, dr. zaius."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "why are we in jerry's apartment?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "well, i, uh, i like to think of this as my conference room. yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "make it quick kramer, my wife and i are about to go bowling."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "oh, well, um, newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "i did. i don't like mr. newman. he is an agitator."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "look... i've known newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. he's a model tenant. portly, yes, but smart as a whip."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "ok, on your word he can stay."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "all right."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "but... i'm gonna keep my eye on him."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "well, you won't regret it."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "what's wrong?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "good working with you."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "all right, let's hit the bricks."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "what?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "oh. uhhh..."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "so joe mayo had the same coat."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "and you threw it out the window?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "mm-hmm."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "god, you're like a rock star."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "so now joe mayo wants me to buy him a new coat."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "because you threw it out."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "no, because i was in charge of the coats. it's... insane."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "but you did actually throw his coat out the window."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "but he doesn't know that. as far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "but that's you."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "so i guess i'll have to buy him a new coat, even though i don't think i should be held responsible, which i am anyway."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "well, i'm satisfied. uh...my back is...killing me."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "of course. because of that wallet. you-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "this...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "look at you. you're on a slant."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "here, just give me a couple of napkins."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "there, there i'm fine."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "what was that?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "i think i had some hard candy in there."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "no, no, this is supposed to go to joe mayo's apartment."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "ahhh. how does this thing work?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "ahhhhh..."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "ready to go?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "all set. i can't believe i'm going dancing."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "you don't go that often?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "no, because it's so stupid. shall we?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "do me a favor. can you hold this stuff for me?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "compact, lipstick, all this?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "and can you help to carry my keys?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "what are you, a medieval dungeon master?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "and a tin of altoids."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "ow! sharp key."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "so, you're sleeping with silvio's wife?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "well, there's very little sleeping going on."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "well, why didn't you tell me about this?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "quite frankly, i don't see how it's any of your business."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "well, it's my business now. look, i stuck up for you. man, if he catches you, we're both out."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "hey, what is that up that tree?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "hoooh! man, that looks like a dead bear."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "no, that's a fur coat! hey, uh, give me a boost."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "the pacific northwest."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "so, you had to carry some of keri's stuff. big deal."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "you don't understand. i went on a successful pocket diet, and i want to keep that weight off."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "you know what? we sell this thing at peterman that would be perfect for you."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "not more of that crap from the titanic?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "no. no. it's a small men's carryall."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "i'm not carrying a purse."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "it's not a purse. it's european."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "utterance": "hey, did george buy joe mayo that chair yet?"

  {
    "utterance": "i don't know."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "if i'm gettin' him a new fur, i'm not chippin' in on a gift, too."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "yeah?"

  },
  {
    "utterance": "no."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "mmm, good. tell him i'm out."

  },
  {
    "utterance": "hey. oh, uh, yeah. uh, here are your pliers back....weak hinge."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "well, i guess i better go and price fur coats."

    "utterance": "88th street? that's where joe mayo lives. that's the coat!"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "what was that pop sound?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "well, i had some hard candy in there."

  {
    "utterance": "so, to what do i owe this unusual invitation?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "come in, come in."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "ahh! this is very much as i imagined it to be. aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "please, sit down. newman, um, i wanted to talk to you about something."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "this isn't about my opening your mail?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "what?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "because i don't, never have, anything i read was already open."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "uh, yeah, uh, no. newman, uh, i heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. and, i believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and i'd like to give it back to him."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "sorry. climbers, keepers."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "you know, newmie. um, i know how you feel about me, and i have to tell you, i'm quite flattered."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "you are?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "oh, yeah. i mean, of all the men that i know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "well, it's-it's interesting work, i don't mind it."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "ha ha ha ha."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "don't you have a-a boyfriend? a, uh, burly, athletic type?"

  },
  {
    "utterance": "cool?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "very cool. so, what do you say? can you do this one little favor, newmie?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "oh, how i've waited for this moment. but alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and i have given the coat to her."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "all right, we're done here."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "for i am in love with svetlana, and i don't care if the whole world knows, except for silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where i would be dancing on the sidewalk--"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "thank you, thank you, thank you very much."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "nice carryall."

  },
  {
    "utterance": "my job was to keep you away from the music."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "what, he doesn't like my taste in music?"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "guess not."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "utterance": "relax, silvio."
  },
  {
    "utterance": "no, that's it. you're both out of the building!"
  },
  {
    "utterance": "oh, come on! hey, newman didn't even give her that! no, that's not even a woman's coat. it's a man's!"
